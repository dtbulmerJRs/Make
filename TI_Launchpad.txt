getting TI Launchpad (Texas Instraments low power MSP 430 MCU) to port in Linux

1. Make a makefile to help you.  run with 'make'
example makefile:
<begin makefile>
# makfile configuration
NAME            = your_proj
OBJECTS         = main.o
CPU             = msp430x2012

CFLAGS          = -mmcu=${CPU} -O2 -Wall -g

#switch the compiler (for the internal make rules)
CC              = msp430-gcc

.PHONY: all FORCE clean download download-jtag download-bsl dist

#all should be the first target. it's built when make is run without args
all: ${NAME}.elf ${NAME}.a43 ${NAME}.lst

#confgigure the next line if you want to use the serial download
download: download-jtag
#download: download-bsl

#additional rules for files
${NAME}.elf: ${OBJECTS}
  ${CC} -mmcu=${CPU} -o $@ ${OBJECTS}

${NAME}.a43: ${NAME}.elf
	msp430-objcopy -O ihex $^ $@

${NAME}.lst: ${NAME}.elf
	msp430-objdump -dSt $^ >$@

download-jtag: all
	msp430-jtag -e ${NAME}.elf

download-bsl: all
	msp430-bsl -e ${NAME}.elf

clean:
	rm -f ${NAME}.elf ${NAME}.a43 ${NAME}.lst ${OBJECTS}

#backup archive
dist:
	tar czf dist.tgz *.c *.h *.txt makefile

#dummy target as dependecy if something has to be build everytime
FORCE:

#project dependencies
main.o: main.c and other headers and c files
<end makefile>

2. start debugger

sudo mspdebug rf2500

3. program using the projects .elf 

prog nameofproject.elf
run

4.  do stuff that you need to do, type help for guidance

you now can program the TI launchpad in linux, without TI Code Composer Studio
